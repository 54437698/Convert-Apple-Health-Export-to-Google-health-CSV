How to use:

Install Pandas 

Put this script into your export folder where all your Apple Health CSVs live.

Run it in IDLE or with:python convert_to_googlefit.py

A new converted/ folder will appear with cleaned CSVs.

Each file will have only three columns:

timestamp,value,unit
2025-09-30T23:12:00+00:00,75,bpm

This version:

Reads tab-delimited Apple CSVs.

Computes midpoint between startDate and endDate as the timestamp.

Outputs timestamp,value,unit.

Handles workouts separately with richer fields.

Good luck...   Apple sucks !
